# XMRGUI
GUI miner for the cryptonight algorithm 

XMR GUI is in development and is in early alpha stages. Feel free to use the miner and submit any bugs. Currently, there are some issues with the initial GPU setup. 

If you have a GPU and already have either CUDA or OpenCL installed click no to both prompts! 

Feel free to leave any and all suggestions for new features as I will be maintaining this regularly. 

Windows builds are in the Release Folder. 

* Many of the features in the GUI do not function yet, please be patient and I will continue to update and add them.

* If you want to update your copy, delete the directory at appdata/XMRGUI and then download the program again.

* OpenSSL Errors are fixed

* Many exceptions have been fixed

* Run on idle feature added. Has an issue updating the GUI on next run but scheduled task still exists and runs.
