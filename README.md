# XMRGUI
GUI miner for the cryptonight algorithm 

XMR GUI is in development and is in early alpha stages. Feel free to use the miner and submit any bugs. Currently, there are some issues with the initial GPU setup. 

If you have a GPU and already have either CUDA or OpenCL installed click no to both prompts! 

Feel free to leave any and all suggestions for new features as I will be maintaining this regularly. 

Windows builds are in the Releases Folder.
